## Softwares and websites required:

Throughout trailblazers, you will be using multiple different apps and many of them are going to be new for most of you. I‚Äôd suggest downloading and getting used to the following at least:

1. XFLR5 (download) [Airfoil and plane analysis (See [Stability](https://docs.google.com/document/u/2/d/1xjP6zcnLnHHdDNcsrQLeZnouvWeKQrqkvAL_Vh24fdo/edit))]
2. MatLab (download) [Can be used to plot graphs (See [Sensitivity](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1yDcOrPyWs8zgsbQVlz-b_HpYM9dDv8_Z) and [Constraint](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1dTTQPI-pcbmbc5sxgoup_16NGqsqKG-F))]
3. ECalc (online tool) [Needed for electronics ([Link](https://www.ecalc.ch/motorcalc.php?authuser=0))]
4. Fusion 360 (download) [Used to make 3d models]
5. Cura (download) [Required for 3d printing]
6. Airfoiltools (online tool) [Needed to help choose your airfoil ([Link](http://www.airfoiltools.com))l]


Refer to ‚ÄòUseful Links‚Äô in the Preliminary Section for the links to some of these. The rest can be downloaded from the net, pretty easily.
