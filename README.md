## Softwares and websites required:

Throughout trailblazers, you will be using multiple different apps and many of them are going to be new for most of you. I’d suggest downloading and getting used to the following at least:

1. XFLR5 (download) [Airfoil and plane analysis (See [Stability](https://docs.google.com/document/u/2/d/1xjP6zcnLnHHdDNcsrQLeZnouvWeKQrqkvAL_Vh24fdo/edit))]
2. MatLab (download) [Can be used to plot graphs (See [Sensitivity](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1yDcOrPyWs8zgsbQVlz-b_HpYM9dDv8_Z) and [Constraint](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1dTTQPI-pcbmbc5sxgoup_16NGqsqKG-F))]
3. ECalc (online tool) [Needed for electronics ([Link](https://www.ecalc.ch/motorcalc.php?authuser=0))]
4. Fusion 360 (download) [Used to make 3d models]
5. Cura (download) [Required for 3d printing]
6. Airfoiltools (online tool) [Needed to help choose your airfoil ([Link](http://www.airfoiltools.com))l]


Refer to ‘Useful Links’ in the Preliminary Section for the links to some of these. The rest can be downloaded from the net, pretty easily.


Some tutorials:
1. [Xflr5](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtl5ylS6jdP6uOxzSJKPnUsvMbkmalfKg): VVVVVV IMP PLS GO THROUGH THIS
2. [Fusion](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrZ2zKOtC_-DR2ZkMaK3YthYLErPxCnT-): [Imp Vids: 1,2,3,4,6,15,18,19,28, and look through anything else you find cool]

## Rules Update

QuarkC posted rules will be followed for the most part, but there will be a few differences in the rules internally, which take priority over whatever is mentioned in the rulebook. Such instances will be announced in this channel and it is expected that all teams will be aware of them.
With that in mind, take note:

1.⁠ Actual report submission deadline will be 7th January, NOT 8th.

 
```
A few other points:/

├── For propulsion, everyone will be using 1000kv motor, 10x47 prop, 3 cell battery.
├── These are the materials you guys will have access to for building
├── 5mm depron 
├── 3mm Balsa
├── 10mm square CF rods pultruded
├── EPS foam block
└── 1.5 / 2mm aeroply
```
